**Description**:  
This project showcases the management, streamline, and data analysis of E-commerce data using Azure & Databricks. The project architecture is based on the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data processing into three distinct layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The bronze layer stores raw data, the silver layer cleanses and enriches it, and the gold layer provides refined, ready-for-analytics data.
